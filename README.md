Assessment

Remwaste is a waste management company with partners in different sectors of the economy. After carefully reviewing the page to be redesigned, I came up with an idea. The idea of the design cycles around environmental sustainability and a green environment.

Working on the project, I made decisions regarding certain things like data fetching, CSS, etc. Since this is a small project, I decided that I wouldn't add a library I didn't necessarily need. Therefore, I used useEffect for data fetching using a custom hook to wrap it, I wrote the CSS rather than using any Library I am proficient at (tailwind, material UI, styled component, etc). I built reusable and maintainable components that made up the page.

Overall, the redesign helps to convey Remwaste's services in waste disposal and management, fostering environmental sustainability and a green environment.
